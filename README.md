# Spam-Mail-Prediction-System
Designed a system that will predict whether entered mail is spam or ham based on mail contents.
This project is based on study conducted on predicting spam mail from emails.Spam mails are also sent through different platforms and these spam mails are difficult to identify that it 
is a spam or ham mail. Spam mail consumes almost 90% of billions of emails sent every day.
This project will identify those spam mails using machine learning techniques. This project will discuss machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression Algorithm and apply it to our data sets. The precision and accuracy 
of the method must be calculated.
